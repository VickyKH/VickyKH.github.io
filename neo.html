<div class="about container">
	<p><strong>A one stop shop for resource hub for new educators.</strong></p>

	<p>As VCH began rapidly hiring clinical educators to meet the demands of lack of health workers, online educational resources was needed to support the initiative.</p>

	<p>This project had two parts: 4 orientation <strong>learning</strong> modules and an online <strong>resource hub</strong>.</p>

	<p>We had two main user groups for this project:</p>
	<div class="column">
		<div class="col-2">
			<p>New educators</p>
			<p>
				Goal: accessing the training modules
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-2">
			<p>Returning educators</p>
			<p>
				Goal: locating educational resources
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Branding & Illustrations</h2>
	<p>
		Borrowing from the existing logo, I created Neo, a mascot character who will guide the user through the course.
	</p>
	<div class="column col-center">
		<img src="work/neo/img1.svg" />
	</div>

	<p>A cast of characters were designed to act as teachers and guides for each module. I drew inspiration from the module themes as well as BC’s wilderness.</p>
	<div class="column col-center">
		<img src="work/neo/img2.svg" />
	</div>

		<p>For example, the first module is an intro to Vancouver Coastal Health. The mascot became a personification of VCH’s logo, which in itself represents the  mountains and rivers of the region.</p>
		<div class="column col-center">

		</div>

		<div class="image-round-box work-image"><img src="work/neo/Intro.png" /></div>


		<h2>Online Resource Hub</h2>
		<p>The online resource hub acts as the entry point for the user starting their orientation.</p>
		<div class="column col-center">
			<img src="work/neo/img1.svg" />
		</div>
		<p>The website acts not only as the entry point for the modules, but also a resource hub for educators. As it will be continued to be accessed after orientation is completed, playful scrolling animations and whimsical imagery was added to delight the user when they return.</p>


		<h2>Learning Modules</h2>
		<p>Although the modules are hosted on the internal learning management system separate from the educator hub, a consistency with branding and mascots help bridge the experience.</p>

		<p>Built in Articulate Storyline 3, modules features different types of interactions to make learning engaging and interesting. </p>

		<h2>Final Remarks</h2>
		<p>The project was launched at an event attended by directors and regional educators. The feedback in the room was positive - the leaders acknowledged how this site would fill the gap they currently have in delivering support to so the different types of educators.</p>
